# TakeIt
Repository for a basic note taking app as part of a presentation. The app has an Android version, a Flutter version, and a web version.

## Summary

TakeIt was written as part of a presentation on Flutter by myself and Matt Cucco. I am an Android developer and Matt is a web developer, so we decided to write the same app, a simple note taking tool, in our respective fields and in Flutter in order to compare the three.
